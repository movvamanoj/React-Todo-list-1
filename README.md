# React Todo List Deployment Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to deploy a React Todo List application to a Kubernetes cluster using Microk8s.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Microk8s
- kubectl

## Step 1: Building Docker Image

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/movvamanoj/React-Todo-list.git
    cd React-Todo-list
    ```

2. Build the Docker image:

    ```bash
    docker build -t react-todo-list .
    ```

## Step 2: Deploying to Microk8s

1. Load the Docker image into Microk8s:

    ```bash
    microk8s ctr image import react-todo-list:latest
    ```

2. Apply the Deployment YAML:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
    ```

3. Apply the Service YAML:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f service.yaml
    ```

## Step 3: Accessing the Application

1. Retrieve the external IP of the LoadBalancer service:

    ```bash
    kubectl get svc react-todo-service
    ```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://external-ip` to access the React Todo List application.

## Cleanup

To clean up resources, run the following commands:

```bash
kubectl delete deployment react-todo-list
kubectl delete svc react-todo-service
```

## Additional Notes

- Make sure Microk8s is running and all required addons (DNS, Dashboard) are enabled before deploying the application.
- You can customize the application by modifying the source code before building the Docker image.
